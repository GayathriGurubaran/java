      * web development

   There are totally 4 types of application in java they are :
             1.Standalone Application: Eg, Anti Virusus, Media Player 
             2.Web Application: Eg, Servlet, JSP, Struts , Spring, Hibernate , JSF
             3. Enterprise Application
             4.Mobile Application 
1. Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling
 and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

2. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
   1991. The small team of sun engineers called (Green Team).

3.Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.

4. After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

Functions :
  it is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused .
  eg : returnType functionName(parameters) {
    // Function Body
    return value; // (if returnType is not void)
}


void meaning :
   public class Example {
    // A function that prints a message (no return)
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, welcome to Java!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet();  // Calling the function
    }
}
op : 
 Hello, welcome to Java!


When a function does not return any value, we use void as its return type.

Meaning: The function executes some task but does not return a value to the caller.

Functions with return type (Not void):
  If a function returns a value, we must specify its return type (e.g., int, double, String).

eg :

  public class Example {
    // Function that returns an integer
    static int add(int a, int b) { // returning int type that (static int )
        return a + b;  // Returning sum
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = add(5, 10);  // Storing returned value
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}

types of functions : 
1. predefined functions :
   eg : Math.pow(x, y), Math.sqrt(x), Math.max(a, b), etc.
2. user defined functions :
   which is defined by us 
3. Functions with parameters and return type 
4. Functions overloading :
    saem name with different parameters 
eg : public class Example {
    // Function to multiply two numbers
    static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    
    // Overloaded function with three parameters
    static int multiply(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a * b * c;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(multiply(5, 10));     // Calls first multiply()
        System.out.println(multiply(2, 3, 4));   // Calls second multiply()
    }
}

5. functions with variable arguments 
6. Pass by value
